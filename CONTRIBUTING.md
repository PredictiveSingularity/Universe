## Hunt bugs

Beurk. Bugs. They crawl Everywhere and always leave such a mess.

If you find one, please don't be alarmed; they won't harm you. Just report it by [opening a detailed ticket](https://github.com/PredictiveSingularity/Universe/issues/new).

It will be dealt with in the most considerate way possible.

## Contribute your time

Not everthing comes out of the box with the Universe.
